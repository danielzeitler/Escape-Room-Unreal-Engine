# Unreal Engine Project

> The project is just for practice purposes and shouldn't represent a finished game with different levels. I just wanted to learn the Unreal Engine, physics system, player control, picking up stuff pressure plates and everything that comes with creating interactive 3D Stuff.

### Some graphics programming practice I did with the Unreal Engine. The project was done with the help of an amazing [C++/Unreal Engine Course](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/).
